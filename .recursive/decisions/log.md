## 2026-04-07 -- Phase 0 Step 0: Agent() Pipe Mode Spike
**Test**: Launched `claude -p` with a prompt that used the Agent tool to spawn a sub-agent. Sub-agent read AGENTS.md and returned `SPIKE-RESULT: # AGENTS.md ## MANDATORY: Session`.
**Result**: SPIKE-PASS. Agent() tool is available in pipe mode, sub-agents execute and return results to parent. No zombie worktrees created.
**Decision**: Proceed with plan as-is. Agent() with `isolation: "worktree"` confirmed working for sub-agent delegation.

## 2026-04-08 -- Session #0107
**Advisory**: security-check (score 75), audit (score 75, tied)
**Decision**: Overrode to AUDIT + EVOLVE in parallel. Rationale: (1) Audit never run in 76 sessions -- framework docs severely stale. (2) Last session already fixed security findings; running another scan before fixing #0201 would re-find the same lib-agent.sh issue. (3) Evolve fixes #0201 (confirmed security vuln in Tier 1 file) which hardens the codebase for the NEXT security scan. Security-check deferred to next session against a cleaner codebase.
**Delegations**: evolve (fix #0201 lib-agent.sh PYTHONPATH), audit-agent (76-session framework audit)
**Outcome**: PR #195 merged (lib-agent.sh hardened), PR #196 merged (7 doc fixes, 4 new tasks). 5 follow-up tasks created (#0202-#0206). make check passes (882 tests).
